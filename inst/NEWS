#  News: to package startupmsg
######################################################################

##############
v 1.0.0
##############

under the hood:
We instantiated a more refined mechanism for startup messages, to avoid 
unnecessary pkg version updates just triggered by startup messages issuing
version information of attached packages upstream, which changes the
reference output of the attaching package and hence creates diffs when
tested on CRAN.

Somewhat more detailed, in the prior regime, suppose we had pkgs pkgA and pkgB on 
CRAN, pkgB importing the NAMESPACE of pkgA via depends, and both pkgs pkgA and pkgB 
had startup messages including version information, and pkgB used the reference 
output <pkgB>-Ex.Rout.save as a unit test for pkgB. Then, whenever we submitted an 
updated version of pkgA to CRAN, we had to also submit a new version of pkgB to CRAN 
regardless whether we had changed anything in pkgB, because of the changed version 
information in the startup message of pkgA which showed up in the reference output 
when pkgA was attached at loading pkgB.

To avoid this, by default our startup messages no longer issue version information
of the attached packages, but --only once per session-- we show a startup message
indicating how to show the prior behaviour, i.e., show the version information
of attached packages in the startup messages.

##############
v 0.9.7 (not submitted to CRAN)
##############

under the hood:
with the help of K. Hornik identified spurious, platform dependent LF/CR issue
and capsulated calls to infoShow() in Rd files by 
## IGNORE_RDIFF_BEGIN
## IGNORE_RDIFF_END

##############
v 0.9.6
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ DESCRIPTION tag SVNRevision changed to VCS/SVNRevision

##############
v 0.9
##############

user-visible CHANGES:
+ title changed to title style / capitalization

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

under the hood:
added .Rbuildignore

BUGFIXES:

##############
v 0.8
##############

under the hood: 
+ startupmsg gains a namespace
+ added DESCRIPTION tag "ByteCompile" to all our packages
+ updating maintainer email address and URL.
+ deleted no longer needed chm folders

##############
v 0.7
##############

user-visible CHANGES:

+ new command TOBEDONE() --- similarly to NEWS() to access TOBEDONE file

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added tests/Examples folder with file startupmsg-Ex.Rout.save to have
  some automatic testing
+ added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files in order to avoid problems 
  with e.g. Windows locale when svn replaces $LastChangedDate
+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files for each package (by accident also in trunc; these are empty so far)

##############
v 0.6
##############

* Rd-style:
  + several buglets detected with the fuzzier checking mechanism
    cf [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25) 
       [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe? , Prof Brian Ripley,

##############
v 0.5.3
##############
  
  * new issuer 'mySMHandler' to cope with long package names and
     variable "paper" widths acc. to getOption("width")
     (automatically inserts line breaks...)
  * moved license to LGPL-3

  
##############
v 0.5
##############

* startup messages are now also of S3-class 'packageStartupMessage'
  and hence may now also be suppressed by 
  suppressPackageStartupMessages() (from package 'base')

##############
v 0.4
##############

* deleted: import "methods" from Namespace
* included: argument "VIGNETTE" in function "buildStartupMessage"

##############
v 0.3
##############

* inserted references to the mail thread 
  "Wishlist: 'quietly' argument for .onAttach() / .First.lib()"
  on r-devel, April 2006 into seealso  

##############
v 0.2
##############

* abolished: S3 class StartupVersionMessage with corresponding constructor
* abolished: call startupVersionMessage
* abolished: control for linestarter (anyone could do this himself: 
             + the developper using his own SMHandler 
             + the user by specifying a suitable custom restart
* abolished: wrapper onlyversionStartupMessages
* abolished: modified output in startMessage

* instead: extended S3 class StartupMessage by a slot 'type' with corresponding
           accessor startupType
* instead: onlytypeStartupMessages with an atypes argument to filter out 
           types that are to be shown
* instead: introduction of mystartMessage with a 
* instead: startMessage now comes with a type argument
* instead/new: SMHandler argument for mystartupMessage and buildStartupMessage
               defaulting to mySMHandler
* clarified: code to buildStartupMessage

* new: separation into "general routines" documented in ?"startmsg"
       and an illustration covering mystartupMessage and buildStartupMessage
       documented in ?"mystartupMessage"
* new: custom restart (idea: Seth Falcon)


##############
v 0.1
##############

* defined S3 classes StartupMessage, StartupVersionMessage with corresponding constructors
* accessor startupPackage
* wrappers suppressStartupMessages, onlyversionStartupMessages
* calls startupMessage, startupVersionMessage
* utilities readVersionInformation, readURLInformation, pointertoNEWS, infoShow, NEWS
* main function buildStartupMessage (also controllable by options "StartupBanner" resp. "StartupLinestarter")
